My first repository (have no idea what I'm doing :))

Hi 
My name is <b>Andy</b> and I'm completely new to this.<br> 
I have no knowledge of programming yet, but I'm learning about HTML (my goal is to then go to CSS and PHP).
The main reason I started learning is because I wanted new job opportunities.<br>
I must say I consider myself a fast learner (and you thought females aren't capable of that :)) and appreciate all the help I can get. My goal is to land a job that will help me support my family (I'm expecting a son in about a week :)) and will keep me interested and happy to learn. 

I will try to do as much learning on my maternity leave as possible and am available for all the comments and help/criticism.

Thank you all so much in advance,

Andy
